# Acid-Assm-Piano
This project implements a virtual piano capturing keys that represent musical notes and using the speaker to reproduce its frequencies.
NOTE: I did not use any compiler for assembly but rather the late debug.exe in MS-DOS. Current versions of winddows do not have it so if you want to run the program you will have to run debug.exe inside DOSBox.
